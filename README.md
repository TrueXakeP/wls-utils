About this repo
===============

I made this repo to share my script and utilities that I use to interact with programs install on my Windows 10 Linux Subsystem (WLS), like PHP or Composer.

You can follow [this article](https://hackernoon.com/experimenting-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux-and-web-development-85180b90382f) to setup a LEMP stack on your windows using WLS, and combine it with the scripts on this repo if you use an IDE like PhpStorm.
